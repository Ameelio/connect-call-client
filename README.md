## Connect Call Client

Connect Call is a service by [Ameelio](https://ameelio.org).

This client provides `RoomClient` bindings for WebRTC-capable environments, and additionally offers React bindings via the `useConnectCall` hook.

## Getting Started

```
npm install connect-call-client
```

```
import { useConnectCall } from 'connect-call-client';
```

## Releasing

1. Review `CHANGELOG.md` and determine the next semantic version
2. Commit a change to `package.json` and `CHANGELOG.md` with the next version. Push the commit.
3. Tag the commit. Push tags.
4. Run `npm publish` to synchronize with NPM
5. Reflect on how NPM doesn't have any mechanism to verify your package contents
6. Marvel at how software works as often as it does
